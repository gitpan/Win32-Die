=head1 NAME

Win32::Die - Dying gracefully under Win32

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Win32::Die;

	die "Hello world";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Windows automatically ("helpfully") closes DOS windows when they quit. 
This can be annoying when your Perl program dies, since you don't get a 
chance to read the error message. Win32::Die detects if your program was 
double-clicked, or run from a command line, and alters %SIG{__DIE__} 
appropriately. The DOS window remains put until you close the window or 
hit a key.  

=head1 NOTES

If another module attempts to catch __DIE__ exceptions, then using 
Win32::Die may cause fatal errors. But there are different methods of 
accomplishing the same effect. Depending on your situation, one of these
methods might be a better solution.
