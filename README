Win32/Die version 0.03
======================

Windows automatically ("helpfully") closes DOS windows when they quit. This can be annoying when your Perl program dies, 
since you don't get a chance to read the error message. Win32::Die detects if your program was double-clicked, or run 
from a command line, and alters %SIG{__DIE__} appropriately. The DOS window remains put until you close the window or 
hit a key.
