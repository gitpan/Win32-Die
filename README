Win32/Die version 0.01
======================

Windows automatically ("helpfully") closes DOS windows when they quit. 
This can be annoying when your Perl program dies, since you don't get a 
chance to read the error message. Win32::Die detects if your program was 
double-clicked, or run from a command line, and alters %SIG{__DIE__} 
appropriately. The DOS window remains put until you close the window or 
hit a key.  

INSTALLATION

It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file in its appropriate local 
Perl subdirectory.
